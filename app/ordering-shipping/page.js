        Orders may be made by e-mail, post or telephone. Please quote the full
        catalogue number(s), and donâ€™t forget to include the delivery address.
        Orders are normally sent by Priority post, postage is added at cost.
        Payment may be made in Euros or in Sterling, bank details will be found
        on the invoice enclosed with the order. Please indicate the preferred
        currency when ordering. The total cost in Euros will be converted to
        Sterling at the current rate at date of invoice. If a direct transfer
        from other currencies is not possible without excessive bank charges we
        prefer to raise a PayPal invoice, this mainly affects Swiss Franc or US
        Dollar transactions. Please do not post cheques drawn on a UK bank to us
        here, as they have to be sent back to England to be paid in, and too
        many go missing in the post. Also no other cheques or international
        money orders, as Austrian banks charge horrendous handling fees for
        these. If you have any questions about our editions please feel free to
        contact us before ordering. Richard & Johanna Carter Oriana Music
